The solution consists of two modules:
- Api
- Client

To start Api server you have to have .NET 8 SDK. 
If you already have it then open Visual Studio -> Package Manager Console and run command [update database] (or run [dotnet ef database update] in cmd)
After the database created you are able to run the project. Do it with visual studio or run command [dotnet run] in cmd.

To start client side you have to have Node.js installed.
After that run [npm install] or [yarn] command.
Once packages are installed run [npm start] or [yarn dev] command to run the project.
Open localhost:3000 url in browser.
Enjoy!
